# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description

A program that allows two human players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I began this project as part of the curriculum for The Odin Project, during which my focus was practice using Ruby and gain a better understanding of the syntax for that language. A few months later, I returned to this project as a way to practice building tests using the Rspec testing framework and to being thinking about how to implement Test-Driven Development in future projects. In addition to those concepts, this project also helped me gain a better understanding of program design and Object-Oriented Programming: Through the process of refactoring my original version, I was able to think through how testable my methods and classes were, and how separating them into more logical files/classes/private and public categories could both simplify my code and make the logic more readable.
